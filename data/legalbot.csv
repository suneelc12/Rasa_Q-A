What is a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and when do I need one?| A Non-Disclosure Agreement is a contract between one or more parties who wish to exchange confidential information while restricting its disclosure and use.\n  \n\n\n\nConfidential information can be any non-public business and/or technical information. Examples of confidential information include specifications, customer lists, trade secrets, know-how, drawings, unpatented inventions, business plans and strategies, financial data, and similar information.\n  \n\n\n\nWhenever company is disclosing confidential information to a third party, the party that is receiving the information must sign a NDA prior to  disclosing the information. This type of NDA can be created using the eNDA System.\n  \n\n\n\nSometimes company is asked to sign an NDA to protect the confidential information of a third party. These types of NDAs create substantial risk for organisation and must always be reviewed by the Law Department prior to signature .
Who all can sign an NDA?|  Only directors and above are authorized to sign NDAs on behalf of organisation. If you will be the primary contact person with the recipient of the confidential information (e.g., supplier, proposed vendor, consultant), you can serve as the NDA Coordinator and should identify yourself as such in the NDA. However, as discussed above, if the NDA imposes confidentiality obligations on Applied, the NDA must be reviewed by the Law Department prior to signature.
Where do signed NDAs go?|The originally signed NDA should be sent to the Law Department. The Law Department maintains a repository of NDAs in its files. The creator or the group for whom the NDA was created should keep a copy for its files.
"What is a Global Supply Agreement (GSA) and when is it supposed to be used? When can I use a ""Pricing Agreement"" instead of a GSA? I cannot find a Pricing Agreement; where can I find one? "|" A Global Supply Agreement (GSA) is an agreement used with suppliers that provide parts which are incorporated into equipment sold by company. These suppliers are sometimes called ""direct"" suppliers. ""Indirect"" suppliers are suppliers that provide goods that are not incorporated into Applied equipment. GSAs are created in collaboration among the Business Unit's, the GSCO organization and the Law Department and set forth the terms and conditions under which company may purchase parts from the supplier. Among other things, GSAs include provisions on IP ownership, warranties, payment, and packaging and transportation requirements. You should go to the iQMS site (Control Procedure 04.2-04-01-01 Supply Agreement) for the most current version of the GSA.  In some cases, a direct-material supplier may provide goods and services pursuant to companies purchase orders without a GSA. This occurs when the supplier is not strategic and it is not important to obtain a long term comprehensive agreement with the supplier. In such cases, Company may use a Pricing Agreement instead of a GSA. For more information about Pricing Agreements, and for information about when a Pricing Agreement can be used, see the ""Instructions and Pricing Agreement"" document on the Supplier Matters page of the Law Department site. Always download the Pricing Agreement from this location. That way, if the Law Department makes changes to the template, you will be using the proper document. \n\nAll GSAs that have negotiated changes, and all Pricing Agreements (regardless whether they have negotiated changes), must be reviewed and approved by the Law Department. \n  \n\n"
How can I find out if Applied has a supply relationship with a particular company, and if so, what contracts govern that relationship?|"First, you can check the Oracle database (with regard to volume manufacturing suppliers) and SAP (with regard to AGS suppliers) to see if the company is listed there as a supplier. (If you do not know how to do this, you should contact someone in the GSCO organization for help; the Law Department cannot assist you with this.) If a company has been approved as a supplier, an F-09 will have been submitted for each facility of that company that will be supporting Applied, and a record of that supplier can be found in Oracle/SAP. Note that because of acquisitions and mergers, and the parent/subsidiary relationships, you may need to search on a variety of names to determine whether a company or one of its affiliates has been an approved supplier to Applied.  \n\nIf you find that the company has been an approved supplier to Applied, the relationship may be governed solely by purchase orders, or there may be other contracts in place, such as the Global Supply Agreement (GSA).   \n\nIf you can identify the Commodity Business Manager (CBM) for that supplier, the CBM is the person to ask about the contracts between Applied and that supplier. (If necessary, you may want to contact the commodity head who has responsibility for the commodity that supplier would provide, to identify an appropriate CBM to ask.)  \n\nFinally, there are ""supplier contract"" databases that can be searched as a supplement to finding and asking the appropriate CBM. The primary database is called the Global Supplier Contract (GSC) Database. Supplier contracts that are specific to AMIL (PDC) are included in a separate database, however, but that separate database is linked from the GSC database. (Note: These databases are access controlled.)  "
Where can I find slides about the state of Applied's business, to share with a supplier?|There is a standard corporate presentation, which is updated quarterly. It is available on the Intranet on the Publications page. For guidance on sharing information with anyone outside the Company, please see the Publications page.
What is the procedure for hiring a consultant or other service provider?|Contact the Global Indirect Materials Organization. GIMO will work with you to issue a purchase requisition, help to negotiate the contract with the consultant/supplier (if needed), and then issue a purchase order once the contract is finalized.
What Web sites do our suppliers use with Applied?|"The following are key Web sites used by our supply base:   \n\nGMOX - This site, which is called the ""Applied Web Site"" in the GSA, is the key tool for communicating with Applied's suppliers. For example, GMOX is how our suppliers access the various attachments to the GSA and other key business process documents, such as packaging specifications and the Transportation Routing Guide. GMOX also has cross-links to other key Applied Web sites.  \n\nOnline PO - This site allows suppliers to access an online purchasing tool, where Applied's purchase orders are issued and accepted electronically. This is also the access point for Applied's Online RFQ tool, which allows suppliers to provide quotes for Items and, if selected by Applied, to have new part numbers added to their supply contracts.  \n\nAP Online - This tool permits suppliers to submit invoices and review payments.  "
What guidance is available if I become aware that one of our suppliers is being acquired?|General guidance is available on the Supplier Matters page of the Law Department's Web site. Generally, the Law Department should be alerted before the acquisition is completed.
A supplier wants to issue a press release about Applied, or put Applied on its Web site as a customer. What do I need to know?|Your point of contact is Richard Lewington (Corporate Affairs) - x6-3450, but first, familiarize yourself with the Applied corporate policy on suppliers'' use of Applied's name, logo, or image
Applied may be disengaging from a particular supplier. What do I need to know?|First, there is a disengagement policy at GMRM 2-44. Second, there is a document available on the Supplier Matters page of the Applied Materials Law Department Web site about protecting Confidential Information in connection with a supplier disengagement.
What are the special rules around joint development activity, or joint development agreements (JDAs)?|"Joint development activity with a supplier is different than a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with a supplier. Organization may conduct joint development activity with a supplier under a Global Supply Agreement (GSA), or under a Consulting Agreement. (Although the standard Supplier Unilateral NDA, available through the eNDA tool, has provisions regarding the assignment of intellectual property (IP), significant joint development activity should not be conducted with a supplier that has only signed an NDA with copmany.\n  \n\n\n\nUnder those standard contracts, the intellectual property (IP) that results from the joint development activity is owned entirely by copmany. In some cases, however, a supplier may only agree to participate in joint development activity if copany enters into a separate JDA that allocates ownership of the new IP in a way that is different than the GSA or the Consulting Agreement. \n  \n\n\n\nCertain signatures are required for Joint Development Agreements by corporate policy found in Attachment A-8 (New Business and Government Commitments) to Policy No. 5.1 in the Finance Policy Manual. Generally, these rules apply whenever company personnel or resources will be used to develop new IP, and company will not be the sole and unrestricted owner of that new IP. \n  \n\n\n\nIf you are aware of any joint development activity, you should contact a member of the Law Department who is listed under the heading ""Direct (Manufacturing)"". Work on a JDA will start after you fill out the JDA Request Form that is linked under the Quick Links heading at the bottom left side of the Law Department Web site.\n  \n\n"
"How do the trade restrictions, ""Established Markets"", ""IP sensitivity"", and ""Regional Amendments"""" to the GSA all relate to one another?"|"These are related, but different concepts. One relates to Applied's protection of its intellectual property (IP). The other relates to Applied's compliance with federal law.  \n\nApplied has determined a list of ""Established Markets"", which are jurisdictions where, in Applied's view, both the laws to protect IP and the enforcement of those laws are well developed. According to Applied policy CORP0151 Rev. C (5/4/07), Established Markets are the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Israel, Japan, and Singapore. The current list of ""Established Markets"" is also available in Form F-09, which is the form required to add new supplier facility as an ""approved supplier"" to Applied. Note: Contractors do not currently have access to the Corporate QMS database, unless specially approved. A copy of CORP0151 is available from the CAMG site, as well.  \n\nIn general, if a supplier's headquarters, the majority of the supplier's organization or the facility that will be supporting Applied is located outside of an Established Market, then no Confidential Information can be sent to that supplier until the Commodity Business Manager (CBM) has contacted the Law Department to determine what requirements must first be met. The disclosure of confidential information may require both a Global Supply Agreement (GSA) and a Regional Amendment to help protect Applied's confidential information.  \n\nIf, however, the supplier facility supporting Applied is located outside an Established Market, but the supplier's headquarters and majority of its organization are both in an Established Market, then Confidential Information can be sent to the supplier under a standard NDA, but no Confidential Information can be sent to the supplier's facility in the non-Established Market, by either Applied or the supplier, until the Law Department is consulted and a decision is made whether a Regional Amendment will be needed.  \n\nIn addition, Applied's IP is classified as high, medium, or low sensitivity. Part numbers that have high sensitivity IP in their design cannot be sourced outside of an Established Market.  \n\nA good source for information about this topic is the Confidential Asset Management Group's Web site. In particular, you should review the Policies and Procedures page under References on that site, and in particular, the ""Supply Chain Confidential Information Disclosure Controls (CORP0151)"""" document available on that page.   \n\nIndependent of Applied's efforts to protect its own trade secrets and other forms of IP, certain Applied technology is export controlled under U.S. law. The Corporate Trade Group's Intranet site launched in the summer of 2007. In addition, that group can be reached by Applied personnel via email at corporate_trade@amat.com. Corporate Trade also offers an AGU course, Crossing the Border. Compliance with these export regulations - like compliance with any legal requirement - is critically important to Applied's success. See, e.g., -HR Policy 7-11- (entitled ""U.S. Trade and Export Policy""), available on the Policies and Procedures page of the CAMG site.   "
Where can I find a reminder about how to label confidential information?|Information (including more FAQs) is available from the Confidential Asset Management Group (CAMG) at http://camg. In addition, you may want to use CAMG's wizard tool to generate a confidentiality label.
We just received several drawings from a supplier. Each one has a legend on them claiming that the drawing is the confidential information of the supplier. Some of these drawings are in fact Applied's drawings. Others may be the supplier's, but we have never signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) agreeing to protect the supplier's information. Can I send these drawings to other suppliers to get a competitive quote? Should I remove the supplier's confidentiality legend first?|Generally, it is Applied's practice not to remove any other company's markings from a drawing, specification, or another document, even under circumstances where the supplier has no right to put that marking on the document. You can ask the supplier to remove the legend or other marking from the drawing or other document, and then to re-send the document to you. If the supplier refuses, or if you have any questions, contact a member of the Law Department for assistance.
Is any training available for me or my team about the legal issues that arise in supply relationships?|"A list of courses on legal topics that are available through Global University is available at the bottom of the home page of the Law Department Web site. These courses include a ""Beginning Contract Training"" course and an ""Advanced Contract Training"" course. The advanced course focuses on the GSA. A description of the Beginning Contract Training, and a copy of the Powerpoint presentation used in that course, are available through the Supplier Matters page of the site."
 What is GSA Roadmap document? Where can I download a copy of it?|The GSA Roadmap is a part of the training binder that is distributed to students in the Advanced Contract Training (GSA) course. The Roadmap lists numerous issues that may arise in a supplier relationship, and discusses how the GSA addresses those issues. It also, in some cases, provides a brief description of some of companies key interests with regard to these issues. Each copy of the Roadmap is numbered and signed out to a particular individual. It is not distributed electronically. If you need a copy of this training binder before you can attend the course, please contact a member of the Law Department to request a copy.
Who should sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) on behalf of company?|Only employees who are director level or higher are permitted to sign NDAs. 
Who should sign a GSA on behalf of Applied?|Only employees who satisfy the delegation of authority policy at GMRM 2-05. (See the various appendices to policy 2-05, in section 10.)
Who should sign an amendment to a GSA on behalf of Applied?|Only employees who would satisfy the delegation of authority policy if the GSA were being signed at that time (instead of an amendment).
When am I supposed to contact the Law Department?|The Law Department should be contacted whenever you have a question about legal rights or obligations, but must be contacted if you are making any binding promise on behalf of the company, other than those that are set forth in one of the following documents: \n  \n\n\n\n•A Global Supply Agreement (GSA), in the form that is then available on GMRM, and that is signed without any changes\n\n•A Supplier Unilateral Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), in the form that is then available from the eNDA tool, and that is signed without any changes\n\n•An Online RFQ and Reverse Auction System Rules and Agreement, in the form that is then in use by Applied's contracting group, and that is signed without any changes\n\n•A standard Purchase Order, in the form that is then generated by company purchasing systems, and that is issued without any changes to the Terms and Conditions of Purchase\n  \n\n\n\nAny commitment to buy goods or services, or otherwise to pay some amount, must be reviewed and approved by the Law Department unless the obligation is set forth on a standard company purchase order or other approved and released template agreement. \n  \n\n\n\nBe particularly careful of Letters of Intent, Memoranda of Understanding, and other documents with similar names. These must be reviewed and approved by the Law Department.\n  \n\n\n\nFor contact information, see the Supplier Matters page of the site.\n  \n\n
Where should I look for information about environmental issues, such as Applied's compliance with environmental regulations in the European Union and China?|A good place to start would be the Environmental Health and Safety Web site. In particular, the Product EHS team is responsible for certain requirements that impact our suppliers. In addition, there is a link to information about China's environmental regulations on the Supplier Matters page of the Law Department site.
